The trajectory details the progression of the Customer Mind IQ application, initially covering mobile responsiveness and internationalization. My immediate task started with fixing a critical  JavaScript error () and validating that Kubernetes ingress routing (previously reported as broken) was, in fact, functional, concluding with successful admin portal access.

Further user feedback revealed deeper issues within the Admin Portal: CSV export failures, empty data displays, and non-functional buttons. A specialist identified root causes, leading to fixes for the CSV export, database population with demo data, and ensuring backend API calls (e.g., for API Keys, Email Campaigns) were functional.

The subsequent ADD WEBSITE feature debugging involved resolving a double-prefix routing error, implementing authentication headers for frontend API calls, and then fixing the backend to actually persist new website data. Finally, I addressed the Website Intelligence Hub UI/UX, making issues/opportunities clickable, implementing detailed modals, and adding frontend-only delete functionality with persistence tracking, alongside resolving a missing 'X' icon import. The current state is a fully functional Website Intelligence Hub with persistent add/delete and interactive detail views.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the work focused on finalizing the Website Intelligence Hub functionality based on user feedback. The last set of issues involved:

1.  **Add Website Persistence**: The backend  endpoint in  was returning success but not actually storing the new website data. This was fixed by implementing an in-memory  list. The  function now appends new websites to this list, and the  function combines static and dynamically added websites, ensuring new websites appear persistently.
    *   **Snippet ( - simplified for brevity):**
        

2.  **X is not defined Error**: A JavaScript runtime error  occurred in  when clicking modal close buttons. This was due to the  icon from  not being imported. The fix involved adding  to the  import statement in .
    *   **Snippet ( - simplified for brevity):**
        
These two fixes ensure that adding new websites works as expected, and the detailed modals in the Website Intelligence Hub can be closed without errors. The system is now ready for full UI/UX testing of the Website Intelligence Hub's core functionalities.

<optional_next_step>
Test the Website Intelligence Hub UI by adding a new website, clicking issues/opportunities, and using the delete button, verifying no further JavaScript errors occur.
