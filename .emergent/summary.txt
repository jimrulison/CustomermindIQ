The AI engineer's work initiated with stabilizing a deployed application, resolving critical 500 errors, MongoDB authorization, and data loading issues by correcting frontend URLs, case-insensitive login, and hardcoded database/port configurations. Subsequently, the Growth Acceleration Engine (GAE) module was built, including backend structure, API, and frontend integration, with access restricted to annual subscribers. The admin panel was consolidated into a secure in-app , and the UPDATE ALL button was relocated.

A key task was enhancing the GAE's training documentation within  with branding and access indicators. When duplicates appeared in GAE, the AI fixed the backend to clear old data and filter for recent opportunities. Extensive admin portal enhancements (15 features) were implemented, addressing user management, discounts, and analytics. A pricing discrepancy between frontend and backend was noted but not addressed. Lastly, a comprehensive multi-tier support system with ODOO integration (backend conceptual) and a simple email system were implemented, with the AI currently demonstrating their integrated functionality within the admin portal.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully implemented and resolved critical backend issues for both the multi-tier support system () and the simple email system (). This ensured both systems are fully functional, correctly handling different support tiers (24hr, 12hr, 4hr + live chat) and various email sending methods (all users, by subscription, custom list, single user) with campaign management.

The corresponding frontend interfaces for both systems have also been fully integrated within the  and a new  component. The admin portal now features dedicated, working tabs for Support Tickets and Email System, enabling administrators to manage customer communications effectively.

The current work involves demonstrating the complete customer communication system to the user. The AI engineer has just completed showing the frontend interfaces for both the support and email systems within the admin portal via screenshots (as per user's request for steps 1 and 2). The next immediate action is to proceed with step 3: testing the complete support workflow, specifically how an admin responds to a customer's inquiry and the customer's subsequent reply.
