The trajectory outlines the evolution of tasks for an AI engineer working on the Customer Mind IQ - Universal Customer Intelligence SaaS Platform. Initially, the user requested an AI-driven training video creation system. However, this quickly pivoted when the user clarified their immediate need: to prepare the existing platform for deployment, focusing on legal compliance and payment integration, and expressing past frustrations with agents. The AI engineer correctly engaged a  to clarify deployment needs, then systematically addressed legal document creation, and subsequently a comprehensive Stripe payment integration, including fixing  dependencies. After confirming the core platform was deployment-ready, the user shifted focus back to creating detailed, professionally styled training manuals and a training portal with PDF download capability. The most recent and critical pivot involves implementing a full authentication and admin system, which the AI engineer is currently in the process of building, having completed the backend components. The workflow demonstrates adaptive task prioritization and problem-solving.

<product_requirements>
The user aims to deploy and enhance the Customer Mind IQ - Universal Customer Intelligence SaaS Platform, a comprehensive SaaS product with 14 AI-powered modules for customer intelligence, marketing automation, and revenue analytics.

**Initial Request (Abandoned):** An automated system to generate training videos for 5 different software applications by leveraging AI for interface analysis, content generation, and presentation material production (Phases 1-4).

**Primary Objective (Current Focus):** Prepare the *Customer Mind IQ* platform for production deployment and enhance user experience and management.

**Implemented Features for Deployment:**
1.  **Legal Documentation:** Creation of comprehensive Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Data Processing Agreement (DPA), Service Level Agreement (SLA), Cookie Policy, and Acceptable Use Policy, all compliant with GDPR/CCPA and tailored for the platform's 14 modules and three-tier pricing (Free/Professional/Enterprise).
2.  **Payment Processing (Stripe Integration):** Implementation of a three-tier subscription model with Stripe for handling payment checkouts, subscription management, transaction tracking, admin analytics, and webhook handling. This includes backend API endpoints and frontend components for subscription management.
3.  **Training Materials:** Creation of a Quick Start Guide and a Complete Training Manual (in professional HTML format) with Customer Mind IQ branding, responsive design, and PDF download functionality via a central Training Portal. These detailed guides cover all modules, features, best practices, and troubleshooting.

**Current Work & Pending Product Requirement:**
*   **Admin Authentication System:** Implementation of a complete authentication system with admin login, user management, role-based access control (Admin/Regular user), session handling, and integration with existing subscription tiers. This is deemed critical for production deployment security.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>

    -   **Changes:** Newly created file.
-   :
    -   **Importance:** Handles the low-level interaction with the Stripe API.
    -   **Changes:** Likely modified or updated to correctly use the Stripe API key from the environment and align with .
-   :
    -   **Importance:** Provides the user interface for displaying and managing subscription tiers, initiating Stripe checkout, and showing subscription status.
    -   **Changes:** Newly created file.
-   :
    -   **Importance:** A dedicated page for quick testing of the payment integration during development.
    -   **Changes:** Newly created file.
-   :
    -   **Importance:** Will contain the core logic for user authentication, password hashing, JWT generation/validation, and user data management.
    -   **Changes:** Newly created file (backend part of current work).
-   :
    -   **Importance:** Defines FastAPI endpoints for user registration, login, logout, password reset, and potentially user profile management.
    -   **Changes:** Newly created file (backend part of current work).
-   :
    -   **Importance:** Contains all generated HTML legal documents (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, DPA, SLA, Cookie Policy, AUP) and an  for navigation, ensuring compliance for deployment.
    -   **Changes:** Newly created directory and files.
-   , , :
    -   **Importance:** Provide professional, branded, responsive, and PDF-downloadable training documentation for users, accessible via a central portal.
    -   **Changes:** Newly created files.
-   :
    -   **Importance:** Lists all Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Changes:** Updated to include , , , and  (to resolve  import errors).
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the frontend implementation for the newly created authentication and admin system.
-   Integrate the authentication system with the existing subscription tiers to enforce role-based access control.
-   The initial request for an AI-driven training video creation system (Phases 1-4) was abandoned and is not currently being worked on.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing a complete authentication and admin system for the Customer Mind IQ platform, a critical security feature missing from the current deployment-ready state.

The work has focused on the backend components:
-   **File created:** 
    -   This file is intended to house the core logic for user authentication, including functionalities like user registration, login, password hashing, and potentially JSON Web Token (JWT) generation and validation for secure session management.
-   **File created:** 
    -   This file will define the FastAPI router for authentication-related API endpoints. This includes routes for user login, registration, and potentially routes for managing user sessions or profiles.
-   **Integration:** The  will need to be included in the main  to make these authentication endpoints accessible.

The work is currently mid-implementation, specifically after creating these backend files. The next immediate steps would involve completing the logic within these files, integrating them into the main FastAPI application, and then proceeding to the frontend implementation of the authentication user interface and logic.
