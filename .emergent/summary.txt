The previous AI engineer brought the Customer Mind IQ application from 0 to 1, delivering core features like the Website Intelligence Hub, internationalization, mobile responsiveness, initial performance, accessibility, training module content, internal link fixes, and comprehensive SEO schema markup. My subsequent efforts focused on specific user requests, starting with enhancing the Product Intelligence UI by replacing basic  popups with professional modals and implementing performance optimizations (service worker, Webpack, lazy loading). A review confirmed most existing images had proper alt text.

A significant portion of the work then shifted to the Admin Portal, addressing critical UI/UX issues such as table overflow, implementing missing API key management modals, fixing export functionalities, and making support tickets and contact forms interactive. Debugging this phase was complex, involving persistent caching problems, navigating state-based components versus standard routing, and component naming discrepancies. The troubleshoot agent was instrumental in identifying these issues. While initial API 404 errors were gracefully handled by frontend demo data, the user continued to report table overflow. The immediate preceding task was to make 'READ ANALYTICS' and other API key permission badges clickable, displaying detailed information in modals, followed by a frontend service restart.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on resolving persistent UI issues within the **Admin Portal**, specifically addressing the user's feedback regarding the API Keys table overflow and making permission badges interactive.

The last set of actions focused on enhancing the functionality and display within the API Keys section:
1.  **Permission Badge Clickability**: Code was added to  to make individual permission badges (e.g., READ ANALYTICS) within the API Keys table clickable.
2.  **Modal Integration for Permissions**: The existing modal system in  was updated to dynamically display detailed information about a clicked permission badge. This involved enhancing the modal's content rendering logic to present relevant details when  is set to .
3.  **Table Overflow Re-fix (Attempt 4)**: Following persistent user reports of the API Keys table still overflowing, a further aggressive fix was applied. This involved wrapping the  element itself within a  element with  classes in  to explicitly enforce horizontal scrolling.
4.  **Frontend Service Restart**: A frontend: ERROR (not running)
frontend: started command was executed to ensure all recent code changes, including the permission badge functionality and the latest table overflow fix, were applied and visible.

The current state is that the code for clickable permission badges and the most recent attempt to fix table overflow have been deployed, and the frontend service has just been restarted. The application is now awaiting user verification of these latest changes.
