<analysis>
The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on enhancing the Customer Mind IQ application by implementing several user-requested features and bug fixes. Initial tasks involved updating outdated subscription tier names across the frontend, backend, and documentation based on provided pricing schedules. This was followed by resolving a critical UI bug where the Create Email Template modal failed to close properly. Subsequently, a new Web Pages Reference section was added to the Admin Portal, providing an organized view of all application URLs. A significant effort was then dedicated to systematically removing all hardcoded test and demo data from both frontend components and backend functions. The engineer also implemented a comprehensive SEO strategy, creating new components and optimizing existing files. Finally, the work shifted to verifying and fixing all internal/external links, resolving backend 404 errors, and at the trajectory's end, was actively implementing a custom 404 page and updating site-wide contact information.

The Customer Mind IQ platform is an AI-driven customer intelligence system. The trajectory's work addressed critical updates and enhancements.
**Problem at Hand (Current Trajectory):** The user identified discrepancies in subscription tier names (e.g., Professional instead of Launch) across the application, especially in chat functionalities. A critical UI bug prevented the Create Email Template modal from closing. The admin portal lacked a central reference for all application URLs. The application was populated with misleading demo data, and a complete SEO overhaul was needed. Finally, broken links and an unhandled 404 page, along with outdated contact information, required attention.

**Implementation Done So Far:**
*   **Tier Name Update:** Replaced outdated tier names (Professional, Basic, AD BASIC, etc.) with current ones (Launch, Growth, Scale, White Label, Custom) in , , , , , and various documentation files (e.g., , ).
*   **Modal Fix:** Fixed the Create Email Template and Create Automated Workflow modals in  to correctly close and reset state upon clicking the 'X' or 'Cancel' buttons.
*   **Admin Portal - Web Pages:** Added a new Web Pages Reference tab to , listing 33 categorized application URLs with interactive open/copy functions.
*   **Demo Data Removal:** Systematically removed all hardcoded demo data from , , and backend functions in  to ensure empty/zero states are displayed until real data is available.
*   **SEO Implementation:** Created a comprehensive SEO strategy including , , , , , , and , targeting key business outcomes.
*   **Link Verification & Fixes:** Addressed missing backend endpoints (, , ), created missing static HTML/PWA files, and resolved a duplicate route definition causing a 404 for the quick start guide.
*   **404 Page & Contact Info:** Currently implementing a new 404 page and updating site-wide contact information to Fancy Free Living LLC, 7901 4th St N STE 300, St. Petersburg, FL 33702 USA info@FancyFreeLiving.com.

-   **Kubernetes Ingress Routing Fix**: The system prompt mentioned an underlying infrastructure issue affecting external  calls for some specific routes that remains unresolved from the previous engineer's work.
-   **Frontend Testing for Tier Updates**: The user chose to manually test the frontend for the tier name changes, so automated frontend testing was not executed by the AI engineer for this task.
-   **Complete 404 Page Content**: The AI engineer could not extract content from the provided  artifact and proceeded with a generic design, which might need user verification or a re-attempt at extraction.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was actively working on implementing a custom 404 error page and updating the site-wide contact information. This involved:
1.  **Extracting 404 Page Content**: An attempt was made to extract the 404 page content from the user-provided  file. This attempt was unsuccessful due to limitations in extracting content from the document type.
2.  **Creating a Generic 404 Page**: Due to the failure in extracting content, the AI engineer proceeded to create a new React component, , to serve as the custom 404 page with a professional design.
3.  **Implementing Contact Page and Details**: New contact information (Fancy Free Living LLC, 7901 4th St N STE 300, St. Petersburg, FL 33702 USA info@FancyFreeLiving.com) was provided by the user. The engineer started creating a  component and intended to place the contact information on a dedicated contact page and at the bottom of every page.
4.  **Integrating Components and Routes**: The  file was being modified to integrate the new  and  components into the application's routing structure.
5.  **Resolving Linting Issues**: During the update of , an ESLint error was encountered: Parsing error: Identifier Footer has already been declared. The engineer identified that both a lazy-loaded  component and a direct import of  existed. The direct import was removed to resolve the conflict and allow the lazy-loaded version to be used.

The last action in the trajectory was the AI engineer stating, Now let me add the contact and 404 routes to the Routes section. Let me find where the routes are defined, indicating the ongoing process of updating  with the new routes.

<optional_next_step>
Integrate the  and  components by defining their routes in  and ensuring the new contact info is displayed as requested.
