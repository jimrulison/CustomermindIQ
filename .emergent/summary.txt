The AI engineer's trajectory involved enhancing the Customer Mind IQ platform from MVP to production readiness, focusing on functional and content updates, followed by extensive debugging of deployment and infrastructure issues. Initially, the work addressed a frontend loading state after login, integrated a knowledge base, branded the login page with a logo, and transformed a marketing slideshow into a training guide. Subsequent user requests led to professional PDF training manuals (initially server-generated, then client-side HTML due to build failures), addition of a new quick reference guide, and placing the logo on all platform pages. The latter half of the interaction was dominated by persistent deployment problems, including  build failures, domain registration issues, frontend-backend URL mismatches, CORS errors, and, critically, recurring MongoDB connection and user permission failures in the deployed Atlas environment. Despite numerous code adjustments to , ,  files, and , the core blocking issue at the trajectory's end remains the inability of the deployed application to interact with MongoDB due to user authorization, indicating an infrastructure configuration problem beyond code.

<product_requirements>
The Customer Mind IQ platform is a SaaS product with 14 AI-powered modules. The user's goal is to deploy and enhance this platform.

**Initially Implemented Features (pre-trajectory):**
*   Legal Documentation: GDPR/CCPA compliant Terms, Privacy, DPA, SLA, Cookie, AUP.
*   Payment Processing: Stripe integration for 3-tier subscriptions (Starter, Professional, Enterprise).
*   Training Materials: Quick Start Guide, Training Manual (HTML), and a central Training Portal.

**New Requirements & Current Focus (during trajectory):**
*   **Admin Authentication System:** Full auth, user management, RBAC, session handling, default admin.
*   **Advanced Admin Features:** Banner management, discount system, account impersonation, analytics.
*   **Subscription Enhancements:** 7-day free trial (no credit card, Starter), updated pricing (9/9 sale Starter, 99/49 sale Professional, 99/99 sale Enterprise).
*   **Training Material Updates:** All guides to reflect new auth, pricing, admin features, and promotional sales.
*   **Knowledge Base Integration:** User-provided educational articles in frontend.
*   **Branding:** CustomerMind IQ logo on login page.
*   **Features & Benefits List:** Generate a factual, comprehensive list.
*   **User-driven requests:** Professional-looking PDF training manuals (auto-download), Logo on all platform pages, Professional Quick Reference Guide PDF.

**Implementation Status:** Most features were addressed in code, but deployment-specific issues (DNS, CORS, MongoDB permissions) currently prevent full functionality on the custom domain.

<pending_tasks>
-   Resolve the  during login on the custom domain (). This error is caused by the deployed MongoDB user () lacking  permissions to the  database in the user's MongoDB Atlas cluster. This is an infrastructure/database administration issue.
-   Confirm successful admin user creation/initialization in the deployed MongoDB Atlas database after permissions are granted.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer had focused on resolving a critical  that occurred during login on the custom domain (). This error manifested as Internal Server Error and SyntaxError: Unexpected token I, Internal S... is not valid JSON, indicating a backend crash.

Through systematic debugging, including adding temporary debug endpoints, the issue was narrowed down to a **MongoDB user permission problem** within the deployed environment's MongoDB Atlas cluster. Specifically, the  user, despite being able to connect to the new user-provided Atlas cluster, lacks the necessary  permissions for the  database. This prevents the application from performing basic database operations, such as checking for or creating the default admin user.

The AI engineer has already:
1.  Updated the  in  to  to resolve CORS issues.
2.  Updated the  in  to the user-provided MongoDB Atlas connection string ().
3.  Removed debug endpoints to prevent build failures.
4.  Ensured the logo is present on all pages () and HTML training guides are downloadable from the  component.

The current state is that the deployed application, after several redeployments, is still hitting an Unauthorized error from MongoDB when attempting to create or find users, even after the user stated they updated permissions to  in MongoDB Atlas. This implies a propagation delay or a disconnect between the reported Atlas configuration and the actual permissions seen by the deployed application's MongoDB user.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Instruct the user to redeploy the application again, as the updated MongoDB connection string and permissions from Atlas may not have propagated to the deployed instance yet. After redeployment, re-test the  endpoint.
