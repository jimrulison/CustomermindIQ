The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Customer Mind IQ application from an initial state to a robust, functional platform by addressing a series of critical product requirements and bugs. Initially, significant effort was dedicated to performance, LLM upgrades, and multi-email provider integration, as well as developing a public training page and updating documentation. A major blocker, a frontend-backend connection issue, was eventually identified by the  as a hardcoded URL in  and was successfully resolved. Subsequently, the engineer integrated new training videos and a quiz document, cleaned up old placeholder videos, and reordered the training content as per user requests. The final task involved debugging and fixing a  runtime error in  by implementing robust defensive programming for API data handling.

Upon taking over, the AI engineer first addressed a widespread external API routing issue (Kubernetes ingress) that caused many functional backend features to appear broken from the frontend. Concurrently, a new data privacy system was implemented, making user data private while visible to admins. The engineer also systematically corrected numerous inconsistencies and functional gaps in the training manual, including page numbering, download links, and the removal of documented fictional features. A comprehensive audit revealed a critically low functionality rate (5%) for interactive UI elements across the platform. The engineer then began methodically fixing these broken buttons, starting with , , and , and is currently working on .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was systematically addressing widespread non-functional interactive elements across the frontend, following a comprehensive audit that revealed a critically low functionality rate for buttons (5% working vs. 50 broken).

The work flow:
1.  **AdminPortal.js**: The engineer started by implementing  handlers and integrating state management for modal visibility and handler functions for various administrative actions, including Create Banner, Create Discount, Generate Codes, Process Refund, Process All Overages, and Export Overage Report buttons. This involved adding  hooks and connecting them to backend API calls. Syntax errors were encountered and resolved.
2.  **CompetitiveIntelligenceDashboard.js**: Subsequently, the focus shifted to fixing the Add Competitor, Record Win/Loss, and Export Analysis buttons. This involved adding respective  handlers, state variables for modal control, and the corresponding modal components to provide interactive functionality.
3.  **CustomerJourneyDashboard.js**: The engineer then moved to this component, beginning the implementation of handler functions for Use This Template, Optimize Journey, Create Touchpoint, and Export Journey Map buttons. The current work halted mid-implementation for , specifically at the point of adding handler functions, with the next immediate step being to attach these handlers to the respective buttons. The overall objective is to ensure all critical UI actions are functional and correctly interact with the backend.
