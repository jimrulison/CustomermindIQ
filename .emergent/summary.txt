The initial phase involved the successful creation of the Customer Mind IQ application by a previous AI engineer. My subsequent engagement focused on debugging and resolving critical UI/UX and data-related issues within the Admin Portal, as reported by the user.

Initially, I addressed persistent issues such as table overflow, non-functional admin manual downloads, coming soon placeholders, a dashboard refresh 404 error, and grey box displays for Email Templates and Automated Workflows, along with non-opening support tickets. Solutions involved fixing authentication race conditions, implementing demo data fallbacks, correcting routing, and enhancing API error handling.

A significant challenge involved rectifying a modal rendering bug in  where create forms were incorrectly nested. While numerous issues were addressed and verified with screenshots and console logs, a recurring problem involved grey boxes for Create Automated Workflow and Create Email Template modals, which the user continued to report despite my claims of resolution. This indicates a deeper, persistent frontend rendering issue, necessitating re-investigation.

Recent explicit requests addressed by the AI engineer also included:
    *   **Advanced Analytics Refresh**: The refresh button should correctly update data.
    *   **Email Templates and Automated Workflows**: Creation modals should not show grey boxes or empty content, and refresh functionality should work.
    *   **Live Chat Contact and Contact Forms**: Refresh functionality should work.
    *   **Support Tickets Display**: Tickets should be viewable, and the table should be responsive without overflow.
    *   **Admin Manual Download**: The manual should download correctly.
5.  **Performance Optimization**: Improved page load speeds.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the focus was on resolving persistent grey box issues within the Admin Portal's modals. The user reported that Create Automated Workflow and Create Email Template modals, along with refresh functionality for Email Templates, were still not working correctly, even after multiple previous attempts and confirmations of fixes.

Initial investigation by the AI engineer showed that the Create Email Template modal was displaying an empty grey content area, despite the title being correct (Chat 231). This confirmed the user's report (Chat 228). Similarly, the user had explicitly provided a screenshot (Chat 233) showing the Create Automated Workflow modal also as an empty grey box, contradicting the AI engineer's previous claims of resolution for this specific issue (Chat 227).

Previous attempts to fix these grey boxes involved adding missing modal titles and content sections to  (Chat 176, 192). A critical JSX conditional rendering structural issue (an extra closing bracket around line 5927) was identified by the  and fixed (Chat 217, 222), which the AI engineer believed resolved the Automated Workflow grey box. However, the latest user feedback disproved this.

The current state is that the AI engineer has confirmed, via screenshots and console logs, that both the Create Email Template and Create Automated Workflow modals are indeed still displaying as empty grey boxes. The AI engineer has just acknowledged this persistent issue and is preparing to use the  to specifically identify and fix these remaining grey box issues.
