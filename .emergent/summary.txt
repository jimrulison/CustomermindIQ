The AI engineer's trajectory commenced with functional and content enhancements, including integrating a knowledge base, branding the login page, and refining training materials. A significant portion of the work then shifted to persistent deployment and infrastructure debugging. Initial attempts addressed frontend loading states, PDF generation (later converted to HTML due to build failures), and logo placement. The core challenge became resolving  during login on the custom domain. The AI systematically debugged frontend URL mismatches, implemented case-insensitive login and password visibility, and updated backend logic. Despite these code fixes and user-reported MongoDB permission updates, the deployed application continued to exhibit MongoDB authorization errors and later, data loading timeouts. The trajectory concluded with the AI diagnosing a recurring infrastructure/routing issue on the custom domain, directing the user to deployment specialists for resolution.

<product_requirements>
The Customer Mind IQ platform is a SaaS product with 14 AI-powered modules. The primary goal is to deploy and enhance this platform for production readiness. Initially, the platform included legal documents, Stripe-integrated payment processing for 3-tier subscriptions, and basic HTML training materials (Quick Start Guide, Training Manual, Training Portal).

Current explicit requirements include:
*   Developing an Admin Authentication System with user management, RBAC, session handling, and a default admin user.
*   Implementing Advanced Admin Features: banner management, discount system, account impersonation, and analytics.
*   Enhancing Subscriptions with a 7-day free trial (no credit card for Starter tier) and updated promotional pricing.
*   Updating all Training Materials to reflect new auth, pricing, admin features, and sales.
*   Integrating a Knowledge Base for user-provided educational articles.
*   Branding the platform with the CustomerMind IQ logo on the login page and all platform pages.
*   Generating a comprehensive list of features and benefits.
*   User-driven requests for professional PDF-like training manuals (shifted to HTML downloads), a Professional Quick Reference Guide, case-insensitive login, and password visibility toggle.

The immediate focus has been resolving critical deployment issues preventing the application from functioning correctly on the custom domain, specifically persistent login failures and data loading timeouts in the Customer Intelligence dashboard.

**Key Files & Changes:**
-   : The main FastAPI application.
    -   Importance: Handles routing, CORS, and application startup.
    -   Changes: Temporary debug endpoints and a  endpoint were added to diagnose database connectivity from the backend. Auth router inclusion was verified.
-   : Backend environment variables.
    -   Importance: Stores .
    -   Changes:  was updated to the user-provided MongoDB Atlas connection string ().
-   : Contains backend authentication logic.
    -   Importance: Manages user registration, login, and token generation.
    -   Changes: Modified  and  functions to handle case-insensitive email lookups and store emails in lowercase for consistency. MongoDB interactions (find and update) were identified as requiring write permissions.
-   : Frontend environment variables.
    -   Importance: Stores .
    -   Changes:  was updated from  to  to match the desired custom domain.
-   : Login/Signup UI component.
    -   Importance: User authentication interface.
    -   Changes: Implemented password visibility toggles (eye/eye-off icons) for password fields and ensured email input is normalized to lowercase for case-insensitive login.
-   : Application-wide header.
    -   Importance: Navigation and branding.
    -   Changes: Displays the CustomerMind IQ logo, ensuring consistent branding across all pages.
-   : Displays training content.
    -   Importance: Central hub for user training materials.
    -   Changes: Updated to include download functionality for various HTML training files, replacing an earlier PDF generation attempt.
-   : Supervisor configuration for services.
    -   Importance: Defines how backend and frontend services are run and their environment.
    -   Changes: An attempt was made to update  to  to resolve routing issues, but the file was noted as read-only.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Resolve External Deployment Infrastructure/Routing Issues**: The primary blocking issue is that backend endpoints (especially  and some data loading endpoints for Customer Intelligence) are not correctly routed or are timing out on the custom domain (), despite working locally. This requires investigation by a deployment specialist.
-   **MongoDB User Permissions Confirmation**: While the user stated updating  permissions, persistent MongoDB authorization errors () indicate a need to re-verify/confirm specific  permissions for the  database in MongoDB Atlas.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the Unable to connect to server error on the custom domain, which manifested as a  during login and later as data loading timeouts within the Customer Intelligence dashboard.

The AI engineer has completed the following:
1.  **Fixed Frontend URL**: Updated  in  to .
2.  **Implemented Case-Insensitive Login**: Modified  to normalize email input to lowercase and  to store and lookup emails case-insensitively.
3.  **Added Password Visibility Toggle**: Integrated eye icons into password fields in  for user convenience.
4.  **Backend MongoDB Configuration**: Confirmed  in  points to the user-provided MongoDB Atlas connection string.
5.  **Initial Troubleshooting**: Added and removed debug endpoints, confirmed local backend functionality (including database connectivity and admin user creation), and verified that  works on the custom domain.

The current state is that while the frontend loads correctly, and authentication works perfectly on , the deployed application on  still faces:
*    for .
*   MongoDB authorization errors () when  is called externally, indicating a permissions problem.
*   Timeout errors for Basic dashboard data in the Customer Intelligence module, preventing the display of detailed analytics, although other modules like Revenue Analytics load successfully.

The core problem has shifted from code-level fixes to an external infrastructure or routing issue on the custom domain, potentially compounded by specific MongoDB Atlas user permissions not fully propagating or being misconfigured. The user has been directed to contact deployment specialists on Discord for further assistance, as this appears to be beyond typical code-based fixes.
