The AI engineer's work primarily focused on resolving critical UI/UX and data-related bugs within the Customer Mind IQ application's Admin Portal. Key challenges addressed included fixing grey box modals for Email Templates and Automated Workflows (resolved by a JSX structural bug in ). The most challenging issue was the persistent Admin Manual Download failure, which required multiple debugging iterations. The root cause was identified as missing authentication headers in the frontend's download request, compounded by initial issues with hardcoded URLs and incorrect  headers in the backend. This was resolved by implementing an authenticated  request in  and ensuring correct  in . Following this, non-functional refresh buttons for Email Templates and Affiliate Monitoring were fixed by adding visual feedback, loading states, and robust function calls. The process involved extensive use of a  and iterative refinement.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed two critical user-reported issues: the non-functional Email Templates and Affiliate Monitoring refresh buttons within the Admin Portal. The user initially reported that these buttons do not do anything (Chat Message 100).

The investigation revealed that while the underlying API calls were generally functional (especially for affiliate monitoring), the frontend lacked proper visual feedback (loading states, spinners, success messages), and the email templates refresh was not consistently triggering its associated loading function.

To resolve this, the AI engineer made comprehensive changes in :
1.  **State Management**: Introduced  and  states.
2.  **Visual Feedback**:
    *   Modified the refresh buttons to display Refreshing... text during operation.
    *   Integrated  icons that animate to provide a visual spinner.
    *   Disabled the refresh buttons while data was being fetched to prevent multiple concurrent requests.
3.  **Functionality Enhancement**:
    *   Ensured  and  functions were robustly called using .
    *   Added detailed console logging to trace the start of the refresh, API calls, and responses for both email templates and high-refund affiliates.
4.  **User Experience**:
    *   Implemented user-facing alert messages upon successful completion of data refresh (e.g., ✅ Email Templates refreshed successfully!, ✅ Affiliate Monitoring data refreshed successfully!).
    *   Included  blocks for both functions to handle potential API call failures gracefully, resetting loading states and displaying error alerts.

These modifications ensure that when a user clicks the refresh buttons, they receive clear visual and textual feedback, indicating that data is being loaded, thereby confirming that the functionality is working as expected and improving the overall user experience within the Admin Portal.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to investigate and resolve the Kubernetes Ingress Routing issue as identified in the pending tasks. This aligns with the user's earlier instruction we will get onto other things after that is done (Chat Message 5), following the successful resolution of the admin manual download and refresh button issues.
