The AI engineer's work transitioned from an initial Odoo-focused email marketing tool to a Universal Customer Intelligence SaaS Platform. A key pivot involved correcting a misinterpretation, leading to the implementation of Advanced Features Expansion over Revenue Analytics Suite, including its backend and UI integration into . The recent focus has been a complete rebuild of the Marketing Automation Pro module. This involved defining detailed new requirements, obtaining third-party integration playbooks (Twilio, Firebase, Facebook/Meta API), and installing dependencies. The engineer then rebuilt all five Marketing Automation microservices in the backend and updated  to integrate them. Finally, the UI was restructured in  to consolidate these new features under a single Marketing Automation Pro tab, mirroring the Advanced Features approach, and resolving related state and import issues. The frontend is currently experiencing slow loading/timeout issues after these changes.

<product_requirements>
The initial product, Customer Mind IQ, was an AI-powered software purchase analytics and email marketing application for Odoo data. It aimed to use AI for behavioral analysis (upsell, churn prevention) and marketing automation, built with React, FastAPI, MongoDB, and an Emergent Universal Key for AI. The vision expanded to a **Universal Customer Intelligence SaaS Platform**, acting as a brain integrating with external systems (Stripe, Odoo, custom APIs for 5 proprietary Emergent-based SaaS products). This platform must pull diverse data, apply AI for customer insights (buying triggers, churn risk, upsell), and push actionable insights back. It must be a **standalone, sellable product** with modular components. Initial modules included Customer Intelligence AI, Marketing Automation Pro, and Revenue Analytics Suite. The Revenue Analytics Suite was clarified to be Advanced Features Expansion, covering Behavioral Clustering, Churn Prevention AI, Cross-Sell Intelligence, Pricing Optimization, and Sentiment Analysis. The latest user request specified a complete rebuild of the Marketing Automation Pro module, detailing new features like Multi-Channel Orchestration (SMS, Push, Social Retargeting), AI-powered A/B Test Automation, Dynamic Content Personalization, Lead Scoring Enhancement, and Referral Program Integration, all grouped under a single Marketing Automation Pro tab in the UI.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on completely rebuilding and integrating the **Marketing Automation Pro module**. The user explicitly requested a full technical implementation of five new sub-features: Multi-Channel Orchestration, A/B Test Automation, Dynamic Content Personalization, Lead Scoring Enhancement, and Referral Program Integration.

The engineer's workflow involved:
1.  **Backend Rebuild**:
    *   Obtained integration playbooks for Twilio SMS, Firebase Cloud Messaging, and Facebook/Meta API.
    *   User requested to implement with mock data initially, as API keys were not available.
    *   Updated  with numerous new dependencies for the advanced features (e.g., , , , , , , ).
    *   Rebuilt the Python files within :
        *    (for SMS, Push, Social Retargeting)
        *    (AI-powered optimization)
        *    (real-time personalization)
        *    (multi-dimensional AI scoring)
        *    (AI viral loop optimization)
    *   Updated  to completely replace the old Marketing Automation Pro endpoints with the new advanced microservices and adjust imports ( added,  removed from this module's imports).
    *   Updated  to export the new services.
    *   Backend testing showed 20 out of 24 (83.3%) of the new endpoints working correctly.

2.  **Frontend Rebuild**:
    *   The user requested frontend testing after backend completion.
    *   The engineer identified that the Marketing Automation and A/B Testing tabs were separate, needing consolidation.
    *   The UI was restructured in  to group all five Marketing Automation features under a *single* Marketing Automation Pro tab, similar to the Advanced Features Expansion tab structure.
    *   This involved modifying  and .
    *   Added  state variable and updated  to fetch data for lead scoring instead of a previous .
    *   Removed a lingering  reference in a separate UI section.
    *   After these frontend changes, testing showed the navigation tabs were visible and the Marketing Automation Pro tab was present, but the page was experiencing slow loading and timeout errors.
