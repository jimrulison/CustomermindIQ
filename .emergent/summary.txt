The AI engineer's work began by stabilizing a previously deployed application, focusing on critical deployment issues, including  during login, MongoDB authorization problems, and data loading timeouts on a custom domain. Initial fixes involved frontend URL corrections, case-insensitive login, and password visibility. A significant turning point was the diagnosis of persistent hardcoded database names and port configurations by a deployment agent, which were promptly corrected across the backend, resolving major deployment blockers.

Subsequently, the focus shifted to implementing the Growth Acceleration Engine module, including its backend structure, API endpoints, and frontend integration. The AI then addressed specific user requests: restricting the Growth Engine to annual subscribers, consolidating the admin panel into a secure, in-app portal, and relocating the UPDATE ALL button to the main Website Analytics dashboard with improved user feedback. The current work involves enhancing the Growth Acceleration Engine's training documentation within the application, making it universally visible, incorporating branding, and refining its design based on a provided slide presentation.

The Customer Mind IQ is a SaaS platform with 14 AI modules aiming for production readiness. Initial requirements included an Admin Authentication System, Advanced Admin Features, enhanced 7-day free trial subscriptions, updated training materials, a Knowledge Base, branding (CustomerMind IQ logo), and a feature list. User-driven requests added professional HTML training, case-insensitive login, and password visibility.

The recent development focused on:
1.  **Growth Acceleration Engine (GAE)**: A new AI-powered module for annual subscribers with four core features: Growth Opportunity Scanner, Automated A/B Test Generator, Revenue Leak Detection, and ROI Calculator & Impact Tracking.
2.  **Access Control**: Restricting GAE access to annual subscribers, with clear visual indicators (Annual Subscribers Only badge).
3.  **Secure Admin Portal**: Migrating the admin panel to a separate, secure in-app portal accessible via a dedicated icon for authorized users.
4.  **UPDATE ALL Button**: Relocating the Website Analytics UPDATE ALL button to the main Website Analytics Dashboard, along with a 15-minute refresh notice and updated FAQ documentation.
5.  **GAE Training Tab**: Creating a detailed training section for the Growth Acceleration Engine within the main Training tab, describing its functionality and usage, visible to all users, with branding.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was implementing the user's latest requests concerning the Growth Acceleration Engine training tab within .

The specific actions being worked on are:
1.  **Visibility**: Ensuring the Growth Acceleration Engine training content is visible to *all* users, allowing them to see the benefits they are missing if they are not annual subscribers.
2.  **Branding**: Adding the CustomerMind IQ logo to the Growth Acceleration Engine training manual section.
3.  **Title Enhancement**: Adding the prominent text AVAILABLE ONLY TO ANNUAL SUBSCRIBERS to the title of the Growth Acceleration Engine training section.
4.  **Design Polish**: Overall refinement of the training manual's design to ensure it looks professional and aligns with the application's branding.

This work directly follows the successful implementation of the Growth Acceleration Engine module, its access control, the secure in-app admin portal, and the relocation and enhanced messaging for the UPDATE ALL button on the Website Analytics dashboard. The current task is the final step in presenting the Growth Acceleration Engine's value proposition and usage instructions within the application's training resources.
