The AI engineer's work involved transitioning an Odoo-focused email marketing tool into a Universal Customer Intelligence SaaS Platform. The initial phase focused on implementing Advanced Features Expansion backend and UI. The subsequent major task was a complete rebuild of the Marketing Automation Pro module, requiring new backend microservices (with initial mock data) and UI consolidation. Following this, the engineer tackled frontend loading issues, which were diagnosed as a client-side problem with API calls after troubleshooting agent guidance. Once resolved, the focus shifted to integrating the Revenue Analytics Suite into the frontend, which also introduced new loading issues due to incorrect API endpoint paths. These were subsequently debugged and fixed, successfully integrating the module. The trajectory concludes with a fully integrated frontend with multiple functional modules and a working backend.

<product_requirements>
The initial product, Customer Mind IQ, was an AI-powered software for purchase analytics and email marketing, specifically for Odoo data, using React, FastAPI, MongoDB, and an Emergent Universal Key for AI. The vision expanded into a **Universal Customer Intelligence SaaS Platform**, acting as a central brain integrating with external systems like Stripe, Odoo, and custom APIs for five proprietary Emergent-based SaaS products. This platform's core function is to ingest diverse data, apply AI for customer insights (e.g., buying triggers, churn risk, upsell), and then push actionable insights back. It must be a **standalone, sellable product** with modular components. Initial modules included Customer Intelligence AI, Marketing Automation Pro, and Revenue Analytics Suite. The Revenue Analytics Suite was re-clarified as Advanced Features Expansion, encompassing Behavioral Clustering, Churn Prevention AI, Cross-Sell Intelligence, Pricing Optimization, and Sentiment Analysis. The most recent and significant request was a complete rebuild of the Marketing Automation Pro module, specifying five new sub-features: Multi-Channel Orchestration (SMS, Push, Social Retargeting), AI-powered A/B Test Automation, Dynamic Content Personalization, Lead Scoring Enhancement, and Referral Program Integration, all consolidated under a single Marketing Automation Pro UI tab. Subsequently, the Revenue Analytics Suite was to be integrated into the frontend.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed the integration of the **Revenue Analytics Suite** into the frontend. This involved:

1.  **Frontend Integration**:
    *   Adding a new state variable  to  to hold data for the new module.
    *   Creating a new asynchronous function  responsible for fetching data for all five Revenue Analytics microservices from their respective backend endpoints.
    *   Integrating  into the main  function, ensuring it's called on application load.
    *   Updating the  component in  to include a new Revenue Analytics Suite tab, increasing the total tabs to 7.
    *   Adding a comprehensive  section for the Revenue Analytics Suite in . This section displays five cards, each representing a microservice: Revenue Forecasting, Price Optimization, Profit Margin Analysis, Subscription Analytics, and Financial Reporting. These cards dynamically display data fetched from the backend.

2.  **API Endpoint Correction**:
    *   Initially, adding the new API calls for Revenue Analytics caused a return to the loading screen issue.
    *   The engineer diagnosed this by reviewing backend  and module files (e.g., ) to confirm the correct API paths.
    *   It was identified that the frontend was making calls to incorrect paths (e.g.,  instead of ).
    *   The API calls within  in  were corrected to use the precise backend endpoint paths, including the  prefix and specific module paths (e.g., ).

Upon resolution of the API endpoint issues, the application successfully loaded, displayed all 7 tabs, and the Revenue Analytics Suite tab was fully functional, showing real, dynamically loaded data for all its microservices with a professional UI. The engineer's immediate next step was to address remaining minor backend issues identified during previous testing.
