The AI engineer successfully initiated development of Customer Mind IQ, an AI-powered customer intelligence platform. Initially envisioned as an analytics and email marketing tool tightly coupled with Odoo, the project underwent a significant pivot. User feedback clarified the need for a **universal, sellable SaaS product** that integrates with *any* external software (like Stripe, Odoo, and the user's own Emergent-based apps) to provide AI-driven customer insights.

The AI engineer adapted by implementing a new architecture featuring a Universal Intelligence Platform with dedicated connector modules. Progress has been made on the backend, with the Customer Intelligence AI and Marketing Automation Pro modules fully functional and tested. Frontend integration for these modules is in progress, addressing UI updates and data fetching. Persistent challenges included Odoo integration issues and general frontend loading problems, which were debugged and confirmed as resolved from the AI's perspective, though user reports still indicated slowness.

<product_requirements>
The initial product goal was an AI-powered software purchase analytics and email marketing application. The core problem involved importing customer data from Odoo, using AI for behavioral analysis (upsell, churn prevention), and enabling email marketing automation. The application needed a React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB, and Emergent Universal Key for AI. Branding was set to Customer Mind IQ with a custom logo.

The vision evolved significantly: the user requires a **Universal Customer Intelligence SaaS Platform** that acts as a brain across *any* software ecosystem. This platform should connect to multiple external systems (e.g., Stripe, Odoo, custom APIs for the user's 5 proprietary Emergent-based SaaS products), pull diverse data, apply AI to understand customer behavior (buying triggers, churn risk, upsell opportunities), and push actionable insights back to those systems (e.g., automated emails via Odoo). The platform must be a **standalone, sellable product** for other businesses to analyze their customer habits, not just the user's own applications. The user explicitly prioritized Stripe and Odoo integrations first. The product is also required to have modular components, starting with 3 main modules (Customer Intelligence AI, Marketing Automation Pro, Revenue Analytics Suite), each with 5 microservices.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **AI Integration**: Leverages Emergent Universal Key for LLM access.
- **API Integration**: Odoo API, Stripe API, general Universal Connector System.
- **Modular Architecture**: Backend modules (Customer Intelligence AI, Marketing Automation Pro) with microservices.
- **UI/UX**: Shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS.
- **Environment Management**: Supervisor for service control, environment variables for configuration.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a standard full-stack setup with distinct  and  directories. Environment variables are extensively used for configuration.

    -   **Changes Made**:  (for AI modules) and  (for universal connectors) were added and installed.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main React component for UI rendering and backend API interaction.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated for Customer Mind IQ branding. Enhanced with client-side error handling and timeouts. Significantly modified to integrate and display data from the new Customer Intelligence AI and Marketing Automation Pro modules, including new tabs, data fetching functions (), and dashboard metric display.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Frontend entry point.
    -   **Changes Made**: Branding updates reflecting Customer Mind IQ.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores  for frontend-backend communication.
    -   **Changes Made**: None, as it contains protected variables.

<pending_tasks>
- **ODOO Integration**: Full resolution of Odoo authentication and data fetching, moving beyond mock data to real data for the initial Odoo connector.
- **Revenue Analytics Suite**: Implementation of the third main module with its 5 planned microservices.
- **Additional Universal Connectors**: Prioritization and implementation of other popular platform integrations beyond Stripe and Odoo.
- **Frontend Enhancements**: Full UI/UX development for all microservices within the Marketing Automation Pro module and the upcoming Revenue Analytics Suite.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on integrating the newly completed **Marketing Automation Pro module** into the frontend. The backend for this module, including its five microservices (Multi-Channel Orchestration, A/B Testing, Dynamic Content, Cross-Sell Intelligence, Referral Program), was successfully implemented and backend-tested with a 100% success rate.

The current work involves modifying  to expose these new Marketing Automation Pro features in the user interface. This includes:
1.  Adding new navigation tabs for Marketing Automation.
2.  Implementing new data fetching functions () to call the Marketing Automation Pro backend endpoints.
3.  Updating the main dashboard to display relevant Marketing Automation Pro metrics alongside existing Customer Intelligence metrics.
The AI engineer has performed multiple edits to  to achieve this, specifically modifying the  and  components, and integrating data loading logic. The very last action taken was to restart the frontend to apply these changes and test the updated interface.
