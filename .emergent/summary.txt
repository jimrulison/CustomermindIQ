The AI engineer's work primarily focused on enhancing the Customer Mind IQ affiliate system and improving the admin portal. Initial efforts involved adding password visibility toggles to affiliate login (found existing) and registration forms (implemented). A significant challenge arose with  due to a persistent frontend caching issue, which prevented requested UI changes (removing a multi-step progress bar, making passwords visible by default) from reflecting. Subsequently, an affiliate login bug was fixed by updating a user's approval status in the backend. A real-time notification system was then implemented in the admin portal, displaying unread counts for various modules. The final task involved adding four new downloadable media resources for affiliates. Throughout this, an overarching infrastructure issue affected external URL connectivity, hindering visual verification of some frontend changes.

<product_requirements>
The Customer Mind IQ platform is an AI-driven customer intelligence system. Core features initially included AI Business Insights, Daily Productivity Intelligence, Knowledge Base, Header Reorganization, and bug fixes. The main requirements from the trajectory centered on a Comprehensive Affiliate Tracking System: a standalone module with independent registration/sign-in, real-time statistics, a chat room, resource integration (documents, marketing banners), and an Affiliate Landing Page Builder System with customizable templates and unique IDs, all ensuring proper branding.

Recent explicit requests included:
*   Add password visibility toggle to affiliate sign-in and registration pages.
*   Remove the 3-step progress bar from the affiliate registration page.
*   Make password fields on the registration page visible by default.
*   Fix affiliate login issues for specific users.
*   Implement an admin notification system (e.g., stars/lights) for support tickets, live chat, affiliate chat, contact forms, and emails in the admin portal.
*   Integrate four new downloadable media assets (audio, video, presentation) into affiliate resources.

<code_architecture>


   - 
      - **Importance:** Manages backend logic for affiliate resources, including retrieval and download tracking.
      - **Changes:** Modified to add four new media assets (audio, video, slideshow, presentation) to the  endpoint and updated categories to include training.
   - 
      - **Importance:** Handles the user registration process for affiliates.
      - **Changes:** Multiple attempts were made to add password visibility toggles, make passwords visible by default, and remove the 3-step progress bar. Despite code being correctly saved, changes are not visually reflecting due to a persistent frontend caching issue.
   - 
      - **Importance:** Handles the user login process for affiliates.
      - **Changes:** Verified to already possess password visibility toggle functionality. A brief test confirmed that icon rendering worked, but text changes were also affected by caching.
   - 
      - **Importance:** Central dashboard for administrative functions and monitoring.
      - **Changes:** Significantly modified to implement a real-time notification system. This involved adding  state, creating a  function to query various backend endpoints for unread counts, integrating this function with  for auto-refresh, defining a  component, and updating the admin navigation to display these badges on relevant tabs (Support Tickets, Live Chat, Affiliate Chat, Contact Forms, Email System).

<pending_tasks>
-   **Kubernetes Ingress Routing Fix**: The underlying infrastructure issue causing external  calls to potentially fail, affecting frontend logins, remains unresolved.
-   **Affiliate Registration Page UI Fixes**: Resolve persistent caching issues to visually implement the removal of the 3-step progress bar and the default visibility of password fields.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully added four new downloadable media assets (an audio file, two video files, and a presentation) to the affiliate resources system. These assets were integrated into the backend's , and backend testing confirmed their successful addition and categorization, including a new training category. The user was then prompted to test these newly added resources.

Before this, the AI engineer implemented a comprehensive notification system within the  component. This system includes real-time fetching of unread counts for support tickets, live chat, affiliate chat, contact forms, and emails, displayed with animated red badges on the admin navigation tabs, and updates every 30 seconds. Additionally, a critical bug preventing affiliate login for  was resolved by updating the account's approval status in the backend to approved. However, persistent frontend caching issues continue to block visual updates to , preventing the removal of the progress bar and default password visibility. An overarching infrastructure issue with the external preview URL is currently preventing both affiliate and main admin portal logins from the frontend, making visual verification of the admin notifications difficult.
