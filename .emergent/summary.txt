The trajectory details the collaborative development of the Customer Mind IQ platform, initially focusing on two critical areas: ODOO CRM integration and rectifying significant frontend stability and data display issues. The ODOO integration spanned two phases: enhancing email capabilities via ODOO, including template management and routing, and then deepening CRM features like sales pipeline and customer data sync. Concurrently, extensive debugging addressed a persistent frontend loading problem, various 500 errors caused by backend JWT and Pydantic enum mismatches, and the complete implementation of previously blank admin dashboard tabs. Finally, the work shifted to developing and refining a landing page, resolving image display issues, updating pricing details, fixing navigation flows, and implementing a prominent logo, culminating in the initiation of crossed-out pricing display.

<product_requirements>
The Customer Mind IQ platform is a SaaS application featuring 14 AI modules, an Admin Authentication System, Advanced Admin Features, a 7-day free trial, and a Knowledge Base. The user's explicit requests and the problem statement driving development include:
1.  **Growth Acceleration Engine (GAE)**: An AI module for *annual subscribers* with strict access control.
2.  **Secure Admin Portal**: Existing admin panel migrated to an in-app portal ().
3.  **Multi-Tier Support System**: Email support (24hr, 12hr, 4hr + live chat) with ODOO integration for CRM. This includes a contact form with an admin page listing.
4.  **Simple Email System**: For administrators to send emails (all, by subscription, custom, single user) with API hookup.
5.  **Detailed Pricing Structure**: New plans (Launch: 9/90, Growth: 5/50, Scale: 99/990, White Label/Custom: Contact Sales) including Founders Pricing, Most Popular badge for Growth, and 2 months free! annual savings. User requested to display specific crossed-out regular prices (e.g., Launch: ~~9~~ 9).
6.  **User-to-Admin Live Chat**: A chat program with user-to-admin functionality. Admin can toggle availability. This feature is restricted to Growth, Scale, White Label, and Custom plan users.
7.  **Landing Page Development**: Create a  page featuring a demo video, dashboard screenshots, correct pricing, a clear call-to-action to the signup flow, and a prominent logo.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Email System API Hookup (General):** While ODOO email integration is complete, the prompt mentions integrate the backend email system with a *specific third-party email provider*. It's unclear if ODOO fully replaces this or if other providers still need specific integration.
-   **Implement remaining crossed-out pricing:** Continue implementing the crossed-out pricing in the remaining pricing sections of the landing page (e.g., under the 2-min demo section, AI-powered customer behavior section, and bottom of the page).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on refining the  page's pricing display based on the user's latest feedback. The user requested to show crossed-out regular prices alongside the current discounted prices. The AI engineer initiated this by asking for the specific regular price values for each tier (Launch, Growth, Scale for both monthly and annual plans). The user provided these values:
-   **Monthly:** ~~9~~ 9, ~~49~~ 5, ~~99~~ 99
-   **Annual:** ~~90~~ 90, ~~490~~ 50, ~~990~~ 990

The AI engineer has already started implementing these changes, beginning with updating the pricing under the 7-day free trial section in . The trajectory ends as the AI engineer moves to update the pricing in the 2-min demo section.

This task is part of a broader effort to make the landing page more compelling and conversion-optimized, following the successful resolution of all admin dashboard functionality, ODOO integration, and initial landing page creation with correct video, logo, and real dashboard screenshots.
