The provided trajectory details a comprehensive development effort on the Customer Mind IQ application, spanning multiple feature enhancements and bug fixes. Initially, the AI engineer transitioned from core AI-powered insights to building a robust affiliate tracking system, encompassing backend APIs, frontend portals, real-time chat, and independent affiliate access. Subsequent work focused on improving the affiliate experience by integrating a rich library of resources (documents, marketing banners) and, significantly, developing an **Affiliate Landing Page Builder System**. This system allows affiliates to create custom, branded landing pages from various templates, each with a unique tracking ID. Crucially, the process involved fixing a major routing bug that redirected affiliate-specific URLs to the general customer login. The final phase concentrated on refining the user interface by replacing generic placeholders with the official CustomerMind IQ logo across all affiliate-facing components, ensuring a professional and consistent brand experience.
