The AI engineer's work began by clarifying initial ambiguous requirements, pivoting from an AI-driven video creation system to preparing the Customer Mind IQ platform for deployment. This involved implementing legal documentation and a robust Stripe payment system with three-tier subscriptions. Following this, training manuals and a training portal were created. The most significant development involved building a comprehensive authentication and admin system, including backend (auth logic, admin features, new subscription system with free trial and new tiers) and frontend integration, which was heavily iterated upon to fix syntax and integration issues. Concurrently, the engineer updated and created new training materials to reflect these changes, including the new pricing and a limited-time sale. The work currently focuses on identifying any missing APIs after these extensive feature additions and UI updates.

<product_requirements>
The user aims to deploy and enhance the Customer Mind IQ - Universal Customer Intelligence SaaS Platform, a comprehensive SaaS product with 14 AI-powered modules. The primary objective is to prepare the platform for production and enhance user experience and management.

**Implemented Features for Deployment:**
1.  **Legal Documentation:** Creation of comprehensive Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, DPA, SLA, Cookie Policy, and AUP, compliant with GDPR/CCPA.
2.  **Payment Processing (Stripe Integration):** Implementation of a three-tier subscription model (Starter, Professional, Enterprise) with Stripe for checkout, subscription management, and webhook handling.
3.  **Training Materials:** Creation of a Quick Start Guide and Training Manual (HTML), with professional branding and PDF download via a central Training Portal.

**New Requirements & Current Focus:**
1.  **Admin Authentication System:** Complete authentication with admin login, user management, role-based access, and session handling, integrated with subscription tiers. This includes a default admin user.
2.  **Advanced Admin Features:** Banner management (create from admin page), discount system (for new/current customers on any tier), account impersonation for support, and analytics (users per tier, cancellations).
3.  **Subscription Enhancements:** Implement a 7-day free trial (no credit card, account hold after trial), and update the pricing structure to Starter (9/9 sale), Professional (99/49 sale), Enterprise (99/99 sale), and Custom tiers. Free trial users should get the Starter plan.
4.  **Training Material Updates:** All existing and new training materials (manuals, guides, scripts) must be updated to reflect the new authentication, pricing, admin features, and promotional sale pricing with strikethroughs and limited time only messaging.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, backed by MongoDB.



**Key Files & Changes:**
-   : Main FastAPI entry. Updated to include  router,  router, and  router. Also modified to add a startup event for creating a default admin user.
-   : Contains core authentication logic (user registration, login, JWTs, password hashing). It also houses the FastAPI router for authentication endpoints.
-   : Newly created. Implements advanced admin features like banner management, discount system, account impersonation, and analytics endpoints.
-   : Newly created. Handles the updated subscription tiers (Starter, Professional, Enterprise, Custom), 7-day free trial logic, and related payment/subscription management.
-   : Updated to include  and ensure  is present for authentication.
-   : Newly created. Provides a React Context for managing authentication state, login/logout functions, and user data across the frontend.
-   : Significantly updated to replace mock authentication with real backend integration via , displaying the new subscription tiers and 7-day free trial.
-   : Modified to include an admin navigation button, visible based on user roles from the .
-   : Updated to integrate with the new backend admin system endpoints for managing banners, discounts, and users.
-   : Modified to wrap the main application with  from , integrating the new global authentication system. Fixed syntax errors during integration.
-   , : Updated with the promotional sale pricing, including strikethrough original prices, bold red sale prices, and LIMITED TIME ONLY badges/banners.
-   , , : Updated to reflect new authentication, pricing, and admin features.
-   : Newly created. Dedicated training manual for the new administrative features.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just completed a significant phase of work:
1.  **Backend Development:** Implemented a full authentication system (), an advanced admin system (), and an updated subscription system () with new pricing tiers and a 7-day free trial. These new modules were integrated into the main .
2.  **Frontend Development:** Created a React  and integrated it into . The  component was updated for real backend authentication,  for admin navigation, and  for backend admin feature integration.
3.  **Bug Fixing:** Resolved several backend issues (Pydantic validation, FastAPI parameter definitions) and a critical frontend syntax error ( duplicate function declaration).
4.  **Testing:** Backend authentication and admin features were tested (), showing most functionality working but some missing endpoints/authentication issues. Frontend was tested via screenshot, confirming UI updates (login page, free trial, pricing tiers, professional design) but also noting an authentication issue preventing login.
5.  **Documentation:** All existing training materials were updated, and a new admin training manual was created, reflecting new authentication, pricing, and admin features.
6.  **Promotional Pricing:** Implemented a limited-time sale pricing structure (9, 49, 99) with visual cues (strikethroughs, red prices, badges) in  and .

The current task is to analyze the existing API implementation in  to identify any missing endpoints required for a complete CustomerMind IQ platform, as requested by the user. The engineer has just started this analysis.
