<analysis>
The previous AI engineerâ€™s work on the Customer Mind IQ application primarily focused on enhancing the Website Intelligence Hub and addressing various feature requests and bugs. Key tasks included initial fixes for mobile responsiveness, internationalization, and a critical  error. Development then moved to fixing CSV exports, populating demo data, and ensuring backend API calls for core modules were functional.

Significant effort was dedicated to the Website Intelligence Hub, starting with debugging Add Website persistence, fixing double-prefix routing, and implementing authentication headers. A major challenge was an environment mismatch where fixes on localhost weren't reflected in the user's preview environment, leading to a persistent data loss perception for the user. Once resolved, the engineer refined the Hub by removing confusing demo websites, implementing persistent add/delete functionality, clarifying pending verification status, and enhancing data displays with detailed issues, opportunities, keywords, and health score explanations. Export functionality was improved to comprehensive PDF reports, and performance optimizations (lazy loading, compression, file cleanup) and accessibility fixes (alt text, ARIA labels, form associations) were implemented. The latest work involves adding a Starter Steps section to the Training module, with the AI currently troubleshooting navigation to verify this feature.

<product_requirements>
The Customer Mind IQ platform is an AI-driven customer intelligence system designed with core features like AI Business Insights, Daily Productivity Intelligence, and a Knowledge Base. The development trajectory focused on several key product requirements:

1.  **Website Intelligence Hub**: Enable users to add and delete websites, view comprehensive analytics, identify issues and opportunities, and analyze SEO and performance details through interactive drill-down modals. This includes persistent data storage, realistic visitor metrics, and detailed, actionable reports.
2.  **Internationalization (i18n)**: Implement language switching for English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, with a prominent selector on all pages, including pre-login affiliate pages.
3.  **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure all interactive UI elements across the application have optimized touch targets (minimum 44px).
4.  **Admin Portal Enhancements**: Address issues like CSV export failures, empty data displays, and non-functional buttons, ensuring robust backend operations for user management, email campaigns, and API keys.
5.  **Performance Optimization**: Improve page load speeds (target under 3 seconds) by optimizing assets, enabling compression, using CDN equivalents, and minifying code.
6.  **Accessibility (A11y)**: Fix missing alt text on images to improve SEO and screen reader compatibility, and enhance form and interactive element accessibility.
7.  **Training Module Content**: Integrate a Starter Steps for Each Level of Experience section into the training module, providing detailed guidance from an uploaded document.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the work was focused on integrating new content into the Training module. The user requested to add a new section called Starter Steps for Each Level of Experience under the training module.

The AI engineer performed the following actions:
1.  **Retrieved Content**: Successfully extracted the content for Starter Steps for Each Level of Experience from the user-uploaded  document.
2.  **Modified **:
    *   Added a new  for Starter Steps after the Manual tab within the  file.
    *   Inserted the extracted content into a new  section for Starter Steps within the same file, positioning it between the Manual and Educational tabs.

The current state is that the code for the new section has been integrated into the  component. However, the AI attempted to take a screenshot to verify this change (Chat Message 504) but the screenshot showed the main dashboard, not the Training module. Therefore, the AI is currently trying to figure out how to navigate to the Training module to visually confirm the successful integration of the new tab and its content.

<optional_next_step>
I will investigate the application's navigation to correctly access and verify the Training module.
