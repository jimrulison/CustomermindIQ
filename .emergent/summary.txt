The trajectory outlines the transition of the Customer Mind IQ application from a previous AI engineer's 0-1 build to the current AI engineer (myself). Initially, the system provided a comprehensive context detailing existing product requirements, codebase architecture, current work, key technical concepts, and pending tasks. The user then explicitly prioritized mobile responsiveness improvements (optimizing touch targets, making the language selector accessible on login) and deferred a Kubernetes ingress fix and automated testing.

My work focused directly on these prioritized tasks. I systematically modified  to enforce a 44px minimum touch target height for all buttons. The  component was enhanced with theme support, and then integrated into  (landing, login, and registration pages) to ensure it's accessible pre-authentication and visually consistent. Further, I iterated through , , and  to manually adjust button and input element styling (padding, ) to meet the 44px touch target requirement. Visual verification via screenshots confirmed the successful implementation and preservation of existing functionality.

<product_requirements>
The Customer Mind IQ platform is an AI-driven customer intelligence system. The core application includes AI Business Insights, Daily Productivity Intelligence, Knowledge Base, Header Reorganization, and general bug fixes. Key development requirements addressed in the 0-1 phase and leading up to current work included:

1.  **Affiliate System Enhancements**: UI/UX improvements (password visibility, no 3-step progress bar), login fixes, integration of downloadable media assets, a 20% commission holdback system for 30 days to cover refunds, admin monitoring for affiliates with >15% refund rates, admin control over pausing accounts and customizing holdbacks, and requiring terms and conditions agreement during registration.
2.  **Admin Portal Notifications**: Implementation of real-time notification system (e.g., stars/lights) for unread support tickets, live chat, affiliate chat, contact forms, and emails.
3.  **Internationalization (i18n) System**: Enable language switching for English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, with a prominent language selector in the header, and translation of all key UI elements and dynamic content.
4.  **Legal Document Integration**: Creation and public accessibility of comprehensive Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed all requested mobile responsiveness improvements and language selector access enhancements. This involved:

1.  **Touch Target Optimization**:
    *   Modified  to ensure all standard button sizes (default, sm, lg) meet a minimum height of 44px (e.g., default: 36px -> 44px, sm: 32px -> 44px, lg: 40px -> 48px).
    *   Iterated through , , and . In these files, all interactive elements such as buttons (e.g., Join Now, Sign In, password visibility toggles, navigation buttons) and input fields were individually updated using  or by adjusting vertical padding (e.g., , ) to ensure they provide a minimum 44px touch target.

2.  **Language Selector Access on Login Page (and other affiliate pages)**:
    *   Enhanced  to accept a  prop, allowing it to adapt its styling for different backgrounds (specifically, a 'dark' theme was created and optimized for affiliate page backgrounds).
    *   Integrated the updated  component into  and placed it prominently in the top-right corner of the landing page, login page, and registration page. This makes language switching available to users before they authenticate.

Visual verification via the  confirmed the successful implementation: the language selector is visible and correctly positioned, buttons appear larger and more touch-friendly, and the overall interface maintains a professional appearance across desktop and mobile viewports. Existing functionality was preserved, and no automated testing was performed, as explicitly requested by the user. The mobile responsiveness improvements are now complete and ready for user review.
