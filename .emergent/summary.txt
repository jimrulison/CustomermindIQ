The AI engineer's work spanned several key areas for the Customer Mind IQ platform. Initially, the focus was on resolving critical frontend caching issues affecting the  component. This involved systematic debugging, applying cache-busting, and confirming UI changes such as password fields being visible by default and the removal of a multi-step progress bar. Following this, a comprehensive internationalization (i18n) system was implemented, adding support for five languages across the frontend, including a language selector in the header and translation of key components like  and . Next, significant enhancements were made to the affiliate module, introducing a commission holdback system, an admin monitoring dashboard for high-refund affiliates, and a terms and conditions agreement during registration. Finally, the engineer created and integrated essential legal documents (Privacy Policy and Terms of Service) with dedicated frontend components and public access. Throughout these phases, the engineer demonstrated a structured approach, confirming plans with the user, performing backend and frontend testing, and addressing issues like incorrect routing for legal documents.

<product_requirements>
The Customer Mind IQ platform is an AI-driven customer intelligence system. The core application has been built to include AI Business Insights, Daily Productivity Intelligence, Knowledge Base, Header Reorganization, and general bug fixes.

The explicit requirements driving the development in this trajectory were:

1.  **Affiliate System Enhancements:**
    *   **UI/UX Improvements:** Add password visibility toggles to affiliate sign-in and registration pages, remove the 3-step progress bar from registration, and make password fields visible by default on registration.
    *   **Login Fixes:** Resolve affiliate login issues for specific users.
    *   **Resource Integration:** Integrate four new downloadable media assets (audio, video, presentation) into affiliate resources.
    *   **Commission Management:** Implement a system to hold back 20% of affiliate commissions for 30 days to cover refunds, releasing the remainder in the next monthly payment after the hold period.
    *   **Refund Monitoring:** Introduce an admin portal feature to flag affiliates with a refund rate exceeding 15% (calculated as (Refunded revenue / Total revenue generated) Ã— 100 over a 90-day average).
    *   **Admin Control:** Provide administrators with the ability to pause affiliate accounts and customize holdback amounts and durations.
    *   **Terms Agreement:** Display affiliate rules and regulations, requiring agreement via a checkbox during registration.

2.  **Admin Portal Notifications:**
    *   Implement a real-time notification system (e.g., stars/lights) in the admin portal for unread support tickets, live chat, affiliate chat, contact forms, and emails.

3.  **Internationalization (i18n) System:**
    *   Enable language switching for users across the entire website.
    *   Support English, Spanish, French, German, and Italian using basic automated translations.
    *   Integrate a language selector prominently in the header navigation (always visible after login).
    *   Translate navigation, common UI elements, form labels, messages, page headers, dynamic content, status messages, and date/time content.

4.  **Legal Document Integration:**
    *   Create and integrate comprehensive Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages into the website, accessible publicly.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented and integrated a comprehensive legal documents system. This involved creating two new markdown files ( and ) containing detailed content. A new React component, , was developed to display these documents with tabbed navigation and integrated into the  router. A  component was also created and added to  to provide consistent navigation to these legal pages. A critical bug was identified and fixed where the legal documents page was not accessible publicly due to an incorrect order of authentication and legal document checks in ; this was resolved by ensuring the legal documents check happens before authentication. The legal documents system is now fully functional, publicly accessible via a URL parameter (), professionally presented, and deemed production-ready.

Before this, the AI engineer extensively enhanced the affiliate module. This included implementing a commission holdback system in  (20% for 30 days, adjustable by admin), adding new admin endpoints for monitoring affiliates with high refund rates (>15% over 90 days), and allowing admins to pause accounts and customize holdback rules. On the frontend,  was updated to include a terms and conditions checkbox with associated validation. The  was modified to integrate an Affiliate Monitoring tab to display and manage these high-risk affiliates. Backend testing confirmed the functionality of the new affiliate system features. Frontend testing was left for the user to perform.
