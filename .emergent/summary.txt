The previous AI engineer's work, inherited by me, started with a summary of critical fixes and enhancements to the Customer Mind IQ application, particularly focusing on the Website Intelligence Hub, internationalization, mobile responsiveness, performance, and accessibility. The immediate preceding task was the integration of Starter Steps content into the Training module.

Throughout the provided trajectory, I addressed several user-requested tasks:
1.  **Training Module Verification**: I resolved a  error in , which was preventing the module from loading. This successfully unblocked and verified the display of the new Starter Steps tab and its content.
2.  **Missing Alt Text**: The user requested fixing alt text on , , and . My investigation revealed no explicit components or routes for these pages, leading to a user clarification request. This task remains pending.
3.  **Mobile Usability Issues**: I successfully enhanced responsiveness across , , and  pages by modifying , , and . This involved optimizing touch targets (), implementing responsive grid layouts, and improving typography for mobile.
4.  **Broken Internal Links**: I fixed various broken internal links, including  placeholders in , a subscription link in , and training portal links in public HTML files. A central redirect system was implemented in  for common 404s, and a  component was created for user-friendly error handling.
5.  **Schema Markup Implementation**: The final task involved implementing JSON-LD schema markup. I created  and  components, integrated them into , enhanced  with SEO meta tags, and generated  and . All changes were verified with screenshots.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the work was focused on implementing comprehensive Schema Markup for the Customer Mind IQ application. This involved:
1.  **Creating **: A new React component to generate JSON-LD for various schema types (Organization, SoftwareApplication, Product, FAQ, Website, Service).
2.  **Creating **: A new React component to generate dynamic breadcrumb JSON-LD.
3.  **Integrating into **: Both new schema components were integrated into the main application component to ensure site-wide structured data.
4.  **Enhancing **: The main HTML file was updated with additional SEO meta tags, including optimized title/description, Open Graph, Twitter Cards, mobile optimization, and preconnect directives.
5.  **Generating SEO Files**:  and  were created in the  directory to guide search engines.

This task has been successfully completed and verified, with screenshots confirming the loading of 7 JSON-LD schema markup blocks and the proper functioning of the application with enhanced SEO features. The AI is currently awaiting further instructions.
