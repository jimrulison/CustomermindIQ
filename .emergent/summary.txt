The trajectory details the handoff of the Customer Mind IQ application from a previous AI engineer to the current one. Initially, the previous engineer established a functional MVP, tackling LLM integration, performance, multi-email support, a public training page, and critical bug fixes like a hardcoded URL in  and a  error in . The current engineer took over, addressing external API routing issues (Kubernetes ingress) and implementing a data privacy system. A major undertaking was a comprehensive platform audit, which revealed only 5% of interactive UI elements were functional.

The current engineer then systematically began fixing these broken buttons. User feedback (Chat Message 5) redirected the engineer to prioritize a Phase 2 audit and fix of all remaining broken buttons *before* completing  (Phase 1). The engineer successfully implemented  handlers and state management for numerous buttons across , , , , , and , reporting significant progress. However, subsequent testing revealed that while handlers were implemented, many buttons were still *missing from the UI*, indicating a deeper rendering or structural issue, along with persistent backend 404 errors for several dashboard endpoints. The engineer is currently investigating this frontend rendering problem.

The Customer Mind IQ platform is an AI-driven customer intelligence system. The primary goal is to provide a robust, interactive platform for customer intelligence. Key explicit requests and problems that have been addressed or are in progress include:

*   **Frontend-Backend Connectivity**: Resolved connection issues stemming from hardcoded URLs.
*   ** Error**: Fixed runtime errors related to non-array customer data in .
*   **Data Privacy**: Implemented a system to ensure user customer data is private, but accessible to administrators.
*   **Admin Manual Access**: Ensured the admin manual downloads correctly.
*   **Training Manual Enhancements**: Added accurate page numbers, linked an FAQ report, provided functional API documentation, fixed 404 errors for quiz/FAQ downloads, and corrected manual content to reflect existing features accurately.
*   **Executive Dashboard Interactivity**: Address, Review large customer health scores, and Implement Strategy buttons were made functional.
*   **Systemic Frontend Button Fixes**: This is an ongoing task involving a comprehensive audit and fixing of non-functional interactive elements across various dashboards and components (e.g., Admin Portal, Competitive Intelligence, Growth Acceleration Engine, Customer Journey Dashboard, Training, Support).
*   **MongoDB Configuration**: Updated hardcoded MongoDB database names to use environment variables.
*   **External API Routing**: The Kubernetes ingress routing issue, causing external  requests to fail, is a fundamental infrastructure problem that remains pending.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Kubernetes Ingress Routing Fix**: The fundamental infrastructure issue causing external  calls to fail remains unresolved.
-   **Complete Frontend Button Functionality**:
    -   Investigate and fix why many buttons, despite having  handlers added, are **missing from the UI**. This indicates a rendering or structural issue.
    -   Address backend 404 errors for dashboard endpoints encountered during testing to ensure full functionality of interactive elements.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was systematically addressing widespread non-functional interactive elements across the frontend. Following user feedback, the current focus was on Phase 2 â€“ conducting a comprehensive audit and fixing all remaining broken buttons. The engineer successfully implemented  handlers and integrated state management for numerous buttons across several components:
*   : Connected handlers for Optimize Journey, Create Touchpoint, Export Journey Map, and Use This Template. (This was initially a Phase 1 task but completed as part of the broader button fixes).
*   : Added and connected Contact Customer and Create Alert buttons.
*   : Connected Upgrade to Annual Subscription.
*   : Connected Upgrade to Annual Plan and Read Article.
*   : Connected Intervene, Assign, Pursue, and added/connected an Export Report button.
*   : Connected Engage, Contact, Convert, and added/connected Implement Strategy and Export Analysis buttons.

After these implementations, the engineer confirmed  was complete. Comprehensive testing was initiated: backend testing revealed several dashboard endpoints returning 404 errors, while frontend testing showed that many buttons, despite being coded, were **missing from the UI** (only 5 out of 16 expected were present). The engineer checked for linting errors, finding many unused imports but no critical syntax issues, and is currently investigating browser console errors and attempting to access components directly to diagnose the missing button rendering issue.
