# Customer Mind IQ - Data Privacy & Isolation System

## 🔒 **PRIVACY IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

The Customer Mind IQ platform now includes a comprehensive data privacy and isolation system that ensures each user's customer data remains private while allowing admin oversight.

## 🎯 **Key Features Implemented**

### **1. Data Ownership & Isolation**
- **Private Data**: Each user's customer data is completely isolated from other users
- **Unique Customer IDs**: Format `{user_id}_{unique_id}` ensures no conflicts between users
- **Owner Tracking**: All customer records include `owner_user_id` and `created_by` fields
- **Timestamp Tracking**: `created_at` and `updated_at` for audit trails

### **2. Role-Based Access Control**
- **Regular Users**: Can only see and manage their own customer data
- **Admins/Super Admins**: Can see all customer data from all users
- **Privacy Filters**: All API endpoints respect user ownership automatically

### **3. Enhanced Data Model**
```json
{
  "customer_id": "admin_u1qbZJv-2dE_c4dd1482",
  "name": "Customer Name",
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "owner_user_id": "admin_u1qbZJv-2dE",
  "created_by": "admin_u1qbZJv-2dE",
  "is_shared": false,
  "created_at": "2025-09-04T22:29:31.443686",
  "updated_at": "2025-09-04T22:29:31.443686"
}
```

## 🔧 **API Endpoints Updated**
