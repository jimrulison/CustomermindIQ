## EMAIL #3: URGENCY & CONVERSION PREP (2 days before expiration)

**Subject:** Your CustomerMindIQ trial expires in 48 hours - Don't lose your data

**From:** Jim, Founder - CustomerMindIQ

---

**Hi [First Name],**

Your CustomerMindIQ trial expires in 48 hours, and I don't want you to lose access to all the insights you've been building.

**Here's what happens when your trial ends:**
- Your dashboards become view-only
- Data connections stop syncing  
- You lose access to AI recommendations
- All your configured alerts and automations pause

**But here's what I really don't want you to lose:** The revenue opportunities CustomerMindIQ has identified for your business.

**Quick question:** Have you discovered any potential revenue leaks or growth opportunities during your trial? Most users find $5,000-$50,000 in previously hidden opportunities in their first week.

**If CustomerMindIQ has shown you something valuable, here's how to continue:**

**Monthly Plans:**
- Launch: $49/month (normally $99)
- Growth: $75/month (normally $149) 
- Scale: $199/month (normally $399)

**Annual Plans (Best Value - 12 months for the price of 10):**
- Launch Annual: $49/month → $41/month + **$3,000 Growth Engine bonus**
- Growth Annual: $75/month → $62.50/month + **$3,000 Growth Engine bonus**  
- Scale Annual: $199/month → $166/month + **$3,000 Growth Engine bonus**

**The Growth Acceleration Engine** (included free with ALL annual plans) typically finds 15-25% additional revenue opportunities within the first 6 months.

**Ready to continue?** Log in to your dashboard and click "Upgrade Account" - it takes 2 minutes.

**Still have questions?** Reply to this email or schedule a quick call to discuss which plan fits your business best.

Don't let 48 hours of momentum go to waste.

Best,  
Jim  
Founder, CustomerMindIQ

P.S. We're still brand new, so you're getting founder's pricing that won't be available much longer. Lock it in now.
